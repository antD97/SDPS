# SDPS

[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/antD97/SDPS/v2.1/total)](https://github.com/antD97/SmiteDPS/releases/tag/v2.1)

A handy tool to calculate DPS in the game [Smite](https://smitegame.com/). SDPS uses the in-game
combat log, so this tool will work seamlessly with future updates containing balance changes, new
gods, and new items.

You can find the download [here](https://github.com/antD97/SmiteDPS/releases/tag/v2.1).

## Usage

1. Extract the zip file and run `SDPS.exe` to start the tool.
2. In the Smite chat, enter `/combatlog toggle piped` to let SDPS see your combat log. This command
   has to be typed in once per game launch.
3. Enter your Smite in-game name and press enter. If you click the save icon, your name will be
   saved for the next time you open the tool.
4. SDPS will begin tracking your damage in your match. Your first tick of damage will start the 
   timer used to calculate DPS, and your DPS will continuously be reported every time you do more
   damage. DPS is calculated from your first tick of damage to the most recent.
5. If you press "Reset DPS Timer", your next tick of damage reset the DPS timer.

## Notes

- If you have "Window always on top" enabled and your Smite "Screen Type" setting set to "Borderless
  Window" or "Window", you can have the tool window display on top of the game which makes DPS
  testing considerably easier.

- **This one is fairly important** depending on the type of scenario you are trying to measure the
  DPS of, in particular burst DPS. If there are multiple ticks of damage that occur at the same time
  (e.g. Qin's Sais), Smite's combat log annoyingly won't be updated until the next combat update.
  The late timing won't mess up the DPS calculation, but this issue can make the DPS output
  misleading. The following screenshots show an example of two ticks of damage arriving late to the
  DPS log.

  There are two missing rows of damage from Qin's Sais and Shifter of Seasons that occurred at the
  same time as the last shown basic attack. These rows are not added until the combat log is
  updated.

- In the "Odin bots" section of jungle practice, there are three Odin bots to the immediate left.
  These bots are handy for DPS calculations. The first one matches your character's level, the
  second one is level one, and the third one is level twenty. There are also buttons to the right
  that let you control the amount of protections they have.

- If the DPS log is empty when you don't expect it to be, make sure your in-game name is typed in
  correctly and then press enter to update the calculator.

- If you are in a match, and the DPS log says "End of file. Searching...", try typing the command
  `/combatlog toggle piped` into Smite chat again. You may have accidentally entered it twice which
  prevents SDPS from monitoring your combat log.
